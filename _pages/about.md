Hello, my name is Hongyuan Lin. I am currently a non-tenured associate professor at the University of Science and Technology of China. My research mainly focuses on data-driven supply chain and revenue management, in particular for e-commerce and logistics business.

Before joining USTC, I completed my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore and my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin.

I am deeply passionate about my research and always looking for opportunities to collaborate and further my knowledge in the field. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for any discussions, collaborations, or inquiries at hylin@ustc.edu.cn.

Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to the opportunity to connect or collaborate!
