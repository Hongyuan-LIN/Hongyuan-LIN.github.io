Hello, my name is Hongyuan Lin. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the National University of Singapore. My research mainly focuses on data-driven supply chain and revenue management, in particular for e-commerce and logisitc companies.

Before joining the National University of Singapore, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin.

I am deeply passionate about my research and always looking for opportunities to collaborate and further my knowledge in the field.

Now, I am particularly excited to share that I am actively seeking faculty positions. To that end, I will be attending several conferences:
  * 2023 MSOM Conference in Montreal,
  * 2023 POMS-China International Conference in Hangzhou,
  * 15th International Annual Conference of the CSAMSE in Shenzhen,
  * 2023 INFORMS Annual Meeting in Arizona.

These events present excellent opportunities for networking, and I am eagerly looking forward to connecting with fellow academics and professionals.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for any discussions, collaborations, or inquiries at lin_hongyuan@u.nus.edu.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope to cross paths with you soon!
